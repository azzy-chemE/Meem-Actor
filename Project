  // ideas and brainstorming 
  // avian biochemistry calculator
  // this would be a web-based calculator that estimates nutritional requirements for
  // birds based on species, weight, and activity level

  // bird feather oil contamination simulator
  // this might simulate how different compounds from oil spills affect feather
  // waterproofing over time? 

  // nest material chemical compatability checker
  // a database of common nest materials and how they would react with environmental
  // chemicals (acid rain for example.)

  // migratory bird biofuel impact map
  // this shows overlap between biofuel crop regions (ethanol/biodiesel)
  // and major migratory flyways

  // avian enzyme temperature kinetics visualizer
  // interactive graph showing how temperature affects digestive enzymes
  // in different bird species?

  // web-based apps?
  // pesticide advisor

  // chemical solvent safety advisor with dow fire and explosion index
  // you can like evaluate explosion and fire risks in chemical plants
  // chemical quantities, storage conditions 
  // might be able to add an air pollution impact on local birds

  // batch reactor simulator
  // continuous stirred-tank reactor - reactant conversion over time
  // reaction kinetics (A turns into B, rate constant)
  // initial concentrations turn into concentration vs. time and yield efficiency

  // plastics biodegradability database: simple i/o program
  // input dropdown plastic type, check environment, and output the decomposition
  // time and microplastic risk to wildlife!

  // air pollution scrubber calculator - designs wet scrubbers
  // gas flow rate (m3/s)
  // ppm
  // outputs scrubber dimensions and efficiency (%)
  // impact on local bird respiratory health?

  // distillation column mini-game, drag and drop trays to optimize benzene
  // and toluene separation
  // so you adjust feed stage + reflux ratio and get purity (%) animation

  // pH impact on feathers, dropdown pH, get a microscopic structure visualization
  // and waterproofing loss
